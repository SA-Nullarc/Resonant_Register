********************
Public Notebooks &amp; studies: any private notes will be kept in a private repo'.

Mostly going to be used within mybinder.org: a public(...) cloud docker. Specified 
for only the usage of publically distributable JupyterLab images.

There is a private one, but currently the only computer I have at the moment is a 
chromebook. Albeit even worse(...): it's under organizational usage; so they blocked 
both ssh and the terminal. 

To add: they grabbed and discussed with Light speed systems, so I'm extremely limited 
currently. Going to be great once I have a android/windows machine again.

Oh well: see ya, 
*unknown~
